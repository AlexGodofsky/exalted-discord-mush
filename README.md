To add new commands create a new file in src/commands. See [yargs docs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#providing-a-command-module) for the format. The handlers all need to be in the same format as you see in the existing commands, or at least they need to guarantee resolve() is called.
